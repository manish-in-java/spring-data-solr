This is an unofficial and unsupported fork of the
[official Spring Data Solr](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-solr)
project created to address the following:

1. Unreleased fixes for critical bugs that are
required for applications in production on an urgent basis.
1. Some code from an
[earlier attempt](https://github.com/manish-in-java/spring-data-search/spring-data-search-solr)
at creating a Solr module for Spring Data that makes it easier to use
the library in Maven projects using token filtering.
